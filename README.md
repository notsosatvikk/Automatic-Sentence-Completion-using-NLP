# Automatic-Sentence-Completion-using-NLP
This project showcases an intelligent system for automatic sentence completion using a pre-trained GPT-2 model, enhanced with Speech-to-Text input. The core functionality is driven by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, enabling dynamic text generation that predicts and completes sentences based on user input.
